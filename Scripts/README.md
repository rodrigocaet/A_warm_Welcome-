### README

In 2018, I started working in another laboratory called LND (Development Neuropsychology Laboratory - UFMG). 
My main duty was to take care of the data sets for many projects. My knowledge and experience in dealing with different data sets were 
utilized when the teacher asked me to merge the different data sets of the project and make some transformations in the data.

Mergind the data sets was not trivial because each project had used different neuropsychological tests and different tabulation formats.

After that, I created a script for a data transformation very common in neuropsychology, calculating a patient's Z Score in a test. 
We generally calculate z scores based on age and other variables. Also we cannot use the R function already incorporated, because in the laboratory 
we have some specificities explained in the folder.

The last script I made for the entire lab was called "descriptive" and is an automated way to calculate descriptive parameters from the data. 
In each new project or paper, the teacher asks the students to make several descriptive analyzes on our data and, before I starting to work in the laboratory 
this was done in SPSS. When I saw the time that students spent to do this, I tried to optimize it and make a script that calculates the main results with less work.
