## This is a folder for presenting the project I made in the course "Applied Data Science Capstone".

This course is the last one of "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate", that I have completed on March 2020.

It involves dealing with geographical data and making clusters with the help of information found in Foursquare. In this folder, a notebook can me found and along with it, a explanation in a form of repport, explaining not only the steps completed in the notebook, but also the results. A presentations is also available and display the information in an easyer-to-read format.
