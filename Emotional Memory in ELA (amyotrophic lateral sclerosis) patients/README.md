#### This project was a master's thesis from the laboratory in which I worked.

It was my first hands-on experience with programming and with real datasets. As the master student and the rest of the team did not know how to program, I was responsible for mergind many datasets (each for each patient included in the study) and prepare it for the analysis.

The inferential analysis were performed in SPSS almost a year later, and I was not involve with the project at this time.
