#### Poster to SBNEC

A typical way of presenting your work as a student in congresses is through poster sessions. Here is an example of a poster made by myself with the help of two post-graduateds students and two professors from the laboratory I worked for (LND). I presented this poster at the X congress of the Brazilian Neurosciences and Behavior Society (SBNeC). The script was made by me and their help was with the dataset, making sense of the results and training of the presentation.
