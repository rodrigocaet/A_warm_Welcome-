\#### Portuguese after English #### 

This is my portifolio, where I put the codes and an explanation of some projects I have worked on. 
Some of them are confidential and I cannot provide much information, such as making available the data I used or the 
final conclusions.

My programming skills are mainly on R and Python, each project will indicate in which language it was built.
Here I'll write a little explanation of each project. They will have their own folder with the code and mor information.

It is written in english because thats the language we use in some of the laboratories.

## Data Manipulation
- **Scrips for LND:** Those are some scripts I made while working at the Laborat√≥rio de Neuropsicologia do Desenvolvimento and that are not tied to a specific project. In this folder there is a score-z script which I used to calculate the z-score in a fashion tipically used in Neuropsychology (and that is not the same way calculated in the R built-in function "scoreZ". There is also a script for doing descriptive analysis in an automated way, which we had to make everytime we merged datasets, to check it.
- **Non-Symbolic Weber Fraction:**

## Data visualization
- **Project: Emotional Memory in ELA (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) patients:** in this project, that was a part of a master thesis from a student that I worked with in my first research experience, I had to merge several datasets and work on them to make visualizations and make it possible to do inferential analysis. I don't have most of the scripts anymore, but one of them is a visualization plot that I presented in a congress. In this folder you can find the script and the poster I presented.
- **Scrips for LND:** in the automated descriptive analysis there is a lot of graphics as well.

## Inferential Statistics tests and Regressions
- **Lateralidade:**

## Machine Learning
- **PCA:**
- **Coursera Capstone:**



## Web-Scraping
- **Populism in Brazil and France:**

### Future works:
- **Natural Language Processing:** Populism in Brazil and France. It is a current project that involves analyzing the speech of the Brazilian President, Bolsonaro and compares it with the president of the political party of the National Rally in France, Marine Le Pen. The next steps will be to create a classifier to differentiate the speeches of the two politicians and evaluate the words used, analysing their similarities using NLP techniques.

- **Image Processing.**
- **Kaggle Challenges**
- **C and C#:** I took a course on introduction to programming where I learned C and a little bit of C#. I can make the scripts I created for the assignments available here in my portfolio.
