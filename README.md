# Under construction

This is my portifolio, where I put the codes and an explanation of some projects I have worked on. 
Some of them are confidential and I cannot provide much information, such as making available the data I used or the 
final conclusions. The title for each project has a link to the folder were all the shareable data is displayed.

My programming skills are mainly on R and Python, each project will indicate in which language it was built.
Here I'll write a little explanation of each project. They will have their own folder with the code and mor information.

It is written in english because thats the language we use in some of the laboratories.

## Data Manipulation and Transformation
- [Non-Symbolic Weber Fraction:](https://github.com/rodrigocaet/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Non-Symbolic%20Weber%20Fraction) This project has two scripts, one that I used for calculating the Weber Fraction (which is explained in the README of the folder) and other that I used to check the results and present the improvements I made in comparison to other calculations made in the laboratory.

## Data visualization
- [Posters and Graphics:](https://github.com/rodrigocaet/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Posters%20and%20Graphics) it is common that psychology students present the research they are involved in congresses. Here I put one of those presentations, with the script I created to perform the analysis that I took to the congress. In all posters I used ggplot2 to make the graphics and performed analysis such as t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests or correlations test in R, and most of them I don't have the script anymore, so I put two poster (each from one laboratory I worked for) as examples and the script of one of them.

## Inferential Statistics tests, Regressions and Machine Learning
- [Lateralidade:](https://github.com/rodrigocaet/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Lateralidade)
- [Coursera Capstone:](https://github.com/rodrigocaet/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Coursera_Capstone) this repository was made with the material I made for the last course of the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate", availabe in Coursera. This project consists of custering the capital from each state of Brazil by the similarities of its stores and market. A K-means algorithm was applied after we got the information about each cities' venues in Fourquare.

## Web-Scraping
- [Populism in Brazil and France:](https://github.com/rodrigocaet/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Populism%20in%20Brazil%20and%20France) the fisrt part of this project was to get speeches from the two polititians we will include in the study. The selected speeches fro Bolsonaro were the ones he profered at "Camara dos Deputados", a Brazilian political venue. Those speeches can be found in a website explained in the folder anda script in R was created to get them, also available in the folder.

### Tools
- [Power BI:](https://github.com/rodrigocaet/data-science-portfolio/tree/master/Populism%20in%20Brazil%20and%20France) dashboard with the Titanic data (available in several places on internet). In the dashboard I had to create new variables, check which variables were more important (by the fit in a logistic regression, because the outcome was binary - survived or not) and build graphics with the most important informations.

### Future works:
- **Natural Language Processing:** Populism in Brazil and France. It is a current project that involves analyzing the speech of the Brazilian President, Bolsonaro and compares it with the speech of Marine Le Pen, a french politician. The next steps will be to create a classifier to differentiate their speeches and evaluate the words used, analysing their similarities using NLP techniques.
- **PCA:** I made a course on Coursera about Principal Components Analysis and applied the knowledge in data from LND. The script and results will soon be made available.
- **C and C#:** I took a course on introduction to programming where I learned C and a little bit of C#. I can make the scripts I created for the assignments available here in my portfolio.
- **Monte-Carlo Simulations:** I am currently involved in a research in the Statistics Department of UFMG, where I analyse through Monte-Carlo simulations, the normality assumption for t-tests and the power curve of the most common goodness of fit tests. The script cannot be shared untill a paper of the research report is publicated.
