### Quick introduction of what is Weber Fraction

The weber fraction is a known Neuropsychological construct that takes in account how the brain process information of different magnitudes of the same type.
A fully known example is when someone carry a weight with one hand and another weight with the other, one weighting the double of the other, people cannot tell if its exactelly the double or not.
What people would notice about the weights would vary with the magnitude of the weights according to the formula bellow.

#### K = delta(i)/i
*i being the magnitude of the stimulus and delta(i) the difference between the magnitudes*

### Weber Fraction in the study of Math Learning
The Non-Symbolic Weber Fraction is a measure of how a person perceive quantities presented in a way they cannot count, such as a number of dots in a screen.
In the Developmental Neuropsychologgy Laboratory, was created three tasks that shows two arrays of points in a screen to a child and they should say which one has more points.
The accuracy usually increases as the difference between the two arrays increases. In the formula, the difference is the **DELTA I** and the magnitude of refference is **I.**

To calculate the Non-Symbolic Weber Fraction for each child, we had to work on the spreadshit given to us as a result of . We also calculated the fit and Rsquared for each children, and some other variables that would help us to know if the function really applied to that child and would facilitates for us to extract more information and not only the Weber Fraction for each child.

Several authors in Neuropsychology study the relationship of the Non-Symbolic Weber Faction and the Symbolic process of children, researching if they can predict Math Learning Disabilities such as Discalculia. A literature review is beyond the scope of this portfolio.
