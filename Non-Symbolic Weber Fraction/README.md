### Quick introduction of what is Weber Fraction

The weber fraction is a known neuropsychological construct that takes into account how the brain processes information of the same type in different magnitudes of the same type.
A fully known example is when someone carries one weight with one hand and another weight with the other hand, one weighting twice as much of the other, people cannot tell if its exactelly the double or not.

What people would notice about the weights would vary with the magnitude of the weights according to the formula bellow.

**K = Δi / i** 

*i being the magnitude of the stimulus (how many kilograms in the weight of refference, in our example) and Δi the difference between the magnitudes*

### Weber Fraction in the study of Math Learning Disabilities
The Non-Symbolic Weber Fraction is a measure of how a person perceive quantities presented in a way they cannot count, such as a number of dots in a screen.
In the Developmental Neuropsychologgy Laboratory, was created three tasks that shows two arrays of points in a screen to a child and they should say which one has more points.
The accuracy usually increases as the difference between the two arrays increases. In the formula, the difference is the *Δi* and the magnitude of refference is *i*.

To calculate the Non-Symbolic Weber Fraction for each child, we had to work on the spreadshit given to us as a result of . We also calculated the fit and Rsquared for each children, and some other variables that would help us to know if the function really applied to that child and would facilitates for us to extract more information and not only the Weber Fraction for each child.

Several authors in Neuropsychology study the relationship of the Non-Symbolic Weber Faction and the Symbolic process of children, researching if they can predict Math Learning Disabilities such as Discalculia. A literature review is beyond the scope of this portfolio.


### The scrips presented in this folder
- In this first script I have created a function that takes as an input a spreadshit and gives back the scores we want to calculate: the Weber Fraction, the fit, the R-squared, the value "p" (another neuropsychological construct), which task does it refers to, etc.
The input spreadshit can be a result of a child in any of the three tasks. The tasks are similar, what changes is the number of output columns, their names and positions. For creating the function, I used parts of a script created by Pedro Pinheiro Chagas e Ricardo José de Moura.
- The second script was a way of checking the results. Most of the Weber Fractions have been already calculated by hand, but the results were not so realiable and it didn't have the fit. So I calculated again the Weber and add the other columns, and now I compared my results with the previously results, to see how many children had the W score and doesnt have anymore (the spreadshit is lost) and other problems that may have happened. This checking was disponibilized for the professor and other students and explained in the text document, also displayed in this folder (to show how I organized this step). This text is in portuguese to be easyer for the students to understand. The next step (of corecting the mistakes) was made by the person who was in charge of the data collection, not me.
